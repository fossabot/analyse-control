Analyse-Control
===============

**Extract the control flow graph from a script.**
Control flow refers to what order a set of instructions execute in. By using
conditional statements and loops, the order of a set of instructions can be
changed. This library extracts all possible execution flows through a script as
a graph of nodes.
